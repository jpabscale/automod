2.2.3: Cached tool downloads in Windows Temp dir to reduce bandwidth. Added the --no-code-patching mod generation CLI option to skip code patching without modifying any script code. Reorganized folders to tidy up top-level folder. Introduced a dedicated patchCustom.sc file for users to customize the script to ease upgrading automod with existing custom code patches. Added UAssetApi.sc to ease creation of UAssetApi JSON objects. Added TOML inline tables and arrays as TOML patch values (for custom scripting code, for now). Added .extra patches (not included in demo mods). AIO: changed moveset/skills to use patches for 1329. Added .demo.aio.base to create AIO demo mod for the base gameplay (and NG+).

2.2.2: Added AES game key config. Made more robust in handling some exceptional cases. Refactored script code for readability. Added .demo and .demo.aio to conveniently reproduce demo mods. AIO: replaced Tempest with fusion chain-stab and Overdrive with fusion sword aura; adjusted burst damages.

2.2.1: More VSCode fixes. Added automod.bat auto-generation during the first launch. Included all-in-one-patches and all-in-one-code-patches-unified in the main distribution, but disabled by default using names with a leading dot (.).

2.2.0: Cached .uasset JSON to speed up subsequent runs if all of the files in the Paks directory have not been modified (based on each file's last modified time and retoc/UAssetGUI versions). Improved VSCode .config.json handling. Refactored sbmod.sc into separate files.

2.1.1: Made the patch loader to ignore files/folders whose name starts with a dot (.) in the patches directory. Prioritized to use a JSON configuration file for some game and tool information (e.g., usmap URL, UE and modding tool versions, etc.) that can be edited directly/via VSCode settings.
